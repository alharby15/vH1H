## What's "McpeProxy" ?
It's a [Minecraft:BE](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition) server which can be used to connect yourself to other [servers](https://minecraftpocket-servers.com/) (the connection passes throughout it).<br/>
It acts as an intermediary beetween you and the real [Minecraft server](https://minecraftpocket-servers.com/), basically a [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server).<br/>

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Proxy_concept_en.svg/400px-Proxy_concept_en.svg.png)

- It is able to "tell" the real Minecraft [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) (**Bob**) whatever he wants
- It is able to "tell" your Minecraft [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)) (**Alice**) whatever he wants
- The Minecraft server thinks the proxy is actually a legit Minecraft client since it acts exactly the same (most of the packets are just forwarded)
- The client will treat it as a normal Minecraft server

For instance, it can "tell" the server you want to hit players, even if you're not.

---
## Why should you use McpeProxy instead of a client-side mod (js scripts) ?
**McpeProxy**
- Can be used on any device (android, ios, windows 10, windows phone, xbox, etc)
- Supports any [Minecraft:BE](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition) version from 0.15 to 1.4 !
- Doesn't require any additional app, just original [Minecraft:BE](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition)
- Cool hacks, constantly growing
- Active development, direct support in case of problems leads to fast bug-fixes and improvements
- Just 5€ for a month of FUN !

**Client-side mod**
- A [Minecraft:BE](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition) launcher is needed (ex: ToolBox for MCPE, McpeMaster, BlockLauncher)
- The launcher only runs on a specific device (usually android)
- Poor and old API ([ModPE](https://duggum.github.io/modpe-api/)) makes it impossible for a js mod developer to create hacks like killaura
- Usually free and full of advertisements.

## What can be done using McpeProxy ?
###### The videos are old, new commands aren't shown! For a description of all the commands, read the [**Proxy in-game commands**](https://gist.github.com/svilex/0409004e9475153590bfa33b61b0f229#proxy-in-game-commands) section.
This is a youtube video showing almost all its features (except the world downloader and newer commands):<br/>

## How to use an McpeProxy?
First of all, the McpeProxy IP & PORT are needed, you can get them buying a [private proxy](https://gist.github.com/svilex/0409004e9475153590bfa33b61b0f229#private-mcpeproxy) or you can use a [public trial](https://gist.github.com/svilex/0409004e9475153590bfa33b61b0f229#public-mcpeproxy) one.<br/>

Once you've got the IP & PORT, add the McpeProxy server to Minecraft, as you would do for a normal external server.<br/>
Here are some images explaining how:

**Open Minecraft and click on "PLAY"**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svilex/res/master/add_proxy_step_1.jpg)

**Tap on the Servers tab (up right corner). Tap on the "Add Server" button**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svilex/res/master/add_proxy_step_2.jpg)

**Fill the form with your McpeProxy IP & PORT**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svilex/res/master/add_proxy_step_3.jpg)

**Tap on "Save", this is how it looks like when the proxy is online and ready to be joined**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svilex/res/master/add_proxy_step_4.jpg)

Once you added the McpeProxy server, join it and start using its commands!<br/>

The list of in-game commands can be found below in the [**Proxy in-game commands**](https://gist.github.com/svilex/0409004e9475153590bfa33b61b0f229#proxy-in-game-commands) section or in-game by typing `*/help` into chat.<br/>

The first command you have to use is `/connect ip:port` to connect yourself to an actual server<br/>

If you are having trouble using McpeProxy, watch my videos and fully read this readme, then, if the problem persists, [contact me](https://gist.github.com/svilex/0409004e9475153590bfa33b61b0f229#contacts).

---
## Private McpeProxy
A proxy costs 5€ a month. Paypal is the only accepted method of payment. If your currency isn't euros, no problem, Paypal will handle the conversion (5 euros equals around 6 usd at the moment of writing)<br/>

By [contacting me](https://gist.github.com/svilex/0409004e9475153590bfa33b61b0f229#contacts) you will receive a [paypal.me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal#PayPal.Me) link and instructions on how to make the payment + you can clear your doubts by asking me anything not coverd or not fully explained in this readme.<br/>

You will receive your proxy in less than 12 hours (usually 10 minutes) after the payment on the place (telegram, kik, ...) you asked for the paypal link.<br/>

**Why is it not for free?**
- McpeProxy is a private proxy server which needs to be hosted, hosting it has a cost.
- Also its development and maintenance has a cost.
- I can't put advertisements on it to compensate my efforts.
---

## Public McpeProxy
Public shared McpeProxy are meant to serve as a trial/proof, they are for free, used by many players and with some limitations:
- Since many players will be using them, there is an high chance servers will ban the proxy IPs as well (you can surely still use them on servers no one knows about) so, **don't be surprised if you can't connect to famous, popular servers using a PUBLIC proxy !**
- **You can use the trial proxies for a total amount of 1 hour then you will be banned for 7 days** to let other players try them also
- Some hacks are limited: `/speedset` values are limited to 4, `/killaura` range is limited to 12, etc (you will find out)

Here is a list:<br/>

IP | PORT
--- | ---
mcpeproxy.tk | 19132

**The proxies above are meant to be used with mcpe 1.2.x or 1.4.x**, other versions of mcpe won't work! (on private proxies other versions of mcpe are supported). It doesn't matter what device you will use to join a proxy, any device where Minecraft runs on can be used<br/>

**If you need your own private proxy server which will be always online and without restrictions (play 24/7 with no hacks limitations) read the section [Private McpeProxy](https://gist.github.com/svilex/0409004e9475153590bfa33b61b0f229#private-mcpeproxy) above**

## Proxy in-game commands

Commands starts with `*/` to differentiate from normal [Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition) commands, if a command isn't working make sure you're typing it right before complaining (happens way too often). For example the command `/help` must be typed `*/help` in the game chat.

The proxy has some default options which cannot be changed in-game using commands:
- When the server sets you onfire, the fire won't be shown, a popup will appear instead
- When the server sets you immobile, you will still be able to move and a popup will appear
- You will always be able to break blocks, even in adventure mode
- The target block of the `/mine` command cannot be changed in-game (can be changed by me if you bought a private proxy)
- WorldDownloader commands are disabled

Command | Description
:---: | ---
**/connect \[ip:port\]** | **Connects the proxy to another server**<br/><br/>Alias: `/c` `/join`<br/><br/>The command syntax is exactly as shown on the left, just replace "ip" with the actual server [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)/[DOMAIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) and "port" with the actual server [PORT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) like this: `/connect 127.0.0.1:19132`<br/><br/>The "port" parameter is optional, if omitted the default mcpe PORT (19132) will be used. For instance you can achieve the same as the above command by using: `/connect 127.0.0.1`<br/><br/>If after using the command successfully you can't join the server:<br/>- Make sure you can join the server without using the proxy<br/>- Make sure the server didn't ban the proxy ip<br/>- Make sure the server isn't a server with encryption enabled (LifeBoat, inPVP, Mineplex)<br/><br/>If the problem persists then please contact me with enough information to reproduce the bug and i will try to fix it.<br/><br/>
**/friend \[add\|remove\|list\]** | **Friends management,names can be partial & case-insensitive**<br/><br/>You can add, remove and list your friends. Why should you add a friend? Because by adding one you won't be able to hit him IN ANY WAY until you remove him from your friends.<br/><br/>`/friend add friendName`      Adds a friend<br/><br/>`/friend remove friendName`   Removes a friend<br/><br/>`/friend list`                Prints the list of all your friends in the chat<br/><br/>"friendName" can be a partial name and case-insensitive (it doesn't matter if you type it upper or lower case) for example if your friend name is "StUpiDnamE" you can use "stup" or "STUPI" or "sTuPId" ... as the name. But be careful, if there is someone else whose name is exactly "stupid", a wrong player will be added as your friend, this usually doesn't happen because once you use the command a message in chat will tell you the exact whole name of the friend added/removed<br/><br/>
**/killaura \[range\] \[mode\]** | **Hits everyone near you except your friends**<br/><br/>Alias: `/ka`<br/><br/>This command toggles killaura ON and OFF.<br/><br/>Killaura attempts to hit players/mobs in the "range" and using a "mode".<br/>The "range" represents a distance in blocks from you.<br/>The "mode" can be either "multi" or "single".<br/><br/>In multi mode the killaura will attempt to hit all the players in the range.<br/>In single mode the killaura will attempt to hit only the closest player to you and in the range.<br/><br/>ATTEMPTS doesn't mean it will force the server to hit a player, we can't do that, it's just NOT POSSIBLE. It will surely tell the server "hey i want to hit this player" but then the server can make the decision to ignore or not the hit ATTEMPT. For example, if you are in a non-pvp zone, the server knows and will ignore the proxy hit attempts, if the hit distance is too much, the server knows as well (since the server knows players positions)<br/><br/>This killaura will hit 4 times per second, more than enough, faster attempts can be ignored by the server or detected by an anticheat resulting in a ban.<br/><br/>Killaura is the best way to kill players, any other hack like "AimBot", "AutoAim" or whatever "AimHack", won't do any better: they just adjust your aim making your head movements look blatant which is absolutely unnecessary, a perfect aim in [Minecraft: Bedrock Edition](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition) is pointless, with touch controls you can hit players even not perfectly looking/aiming at them (in a field of view of 180°) so, use killaura, your head won't move at all (by using `/ghost`) and you don't have to continuously tap on the screen<br/><br/>Usually hacks are wrongly using the name killaura to referr to AimBot and get more attention, mine instead is a REAL killaura, you can stay still, it will hit players AUTOMATICALLY !<br/><br/>
**/ghost** | **Toggles ghost mode (reduces blatant hack behaviours)**<br/><br/>This command toggles the ghost mode ON and OFF.<br/><br/>When the ghost mode is on:<br/><br/>- Killaura will only hit players in your field of view instead of all around you, rapid head rotations won't draw admins attention anymore !<br/>- Killaura will hit at a lower rate of 2 times per second instead of 4<br/>- Random numbers/letters will be appended to spam messages<br/><br/>You will still be able to select `multi` or `single` mode for the killaura, `single` is recommended combined with ghost mode and a low range if you want to look like a normal player.<br/><br/>
**/bb \[width\] \[height\]** | **Sets player's BoundingBoxes, "/bb" alone resets them to "default"**<br/><br/>This command sets player's BoundingBoxes to the specified width and height.<br>Example: `/bb 10 10` will make you able to hit the players from around 5 (width/2) blocks of distance.<br/><br/>You don't even have to tap/click directly on the players but just the air inside the BoundingBoxes.<br/><br/>Wide BoundingBoxes (around 20x20 , depends on the device performance) can cause lag (fps drop) or crash<br/><br/>[video showing how this command works](https://youtu.be/5KfmxSon7OI)<br/><br/>
**/speed \[value\]** | **sets your speed to a value from 1 to 10**<br/><br/>Alias: `/speedset`<br/><br/>This command lets you change your movement speed using a scale from 1(slower/default minecraft value) to 10 (fastest)<br/>After using the command the speed is set client side and to use it you can either walk or sprint, it's the same.<br/>To reset the speed to default just use `/speedset 1` or `/speedset` with no parameters<br/><br/>
**/motion \[x\] \[y\] \[z\]** | **Sets motion multiplier values, useful to modify\|cancel server "pushes" like KnockBack**<br/><br/>This command sets the motion multiplier values (x, y, z) which the proxy will use to multiply the ones sent by the server.<br/>x, y, z are by default all set to 1 so the "pushes" sent by the server won't change (because any number multiplied by 1 equals the number itself?)<br/><br/>**Example of usage:**<br/>`/motion 0 0 0` This will make the client ignore any "push" sent by the server: if someone hits you, you won't move.<br/>`/motion 0 1.6 0` "Pushes" you up when someone hits you since the Y sent by the server will be multiplied by 1.6, the X and Z will be zeroed.<br/>`/motion -1.5 1.5 -1.5` Will "push" you in the opposite direction and with more power (which is evenly distributed on both x,y,z)<br/><br/>Adjust the values as you like once you understood how they are gonna modify the motions, do not use very high values, the game may lag/crash and the server will most likely kick you or reverse your movements<br><br/>
**/fly** | **Toggles "allow fly" (suggestion: use it in combination with "/motion 0 0 0")**<br/><br/>This command toggles "allow fly", if ON, double tapping the jump button will let you fly.<br/><br/>In case you're pulled to the ground while flying, use the command `/motion 0 0 0` which will cancel the pull.<br/><br/>Flying for too much may cause a ban if the server has a good anticheat or if an admin sees you, be careful.<br/><br/>
**/noclip** | **Toggles no-clip (ability to go inside blocks)**<br/><br/>This command toggles no-clip ON and OFF.<br/>No-clip is the ability to go inside blocks like when you're in spectator mode.<br/>The no-clip is only set client side so the server may push you out of blocks and give you damage for suffocation<br/><br/>
**/gamemode \[mode\]** | **Sets your gamemode to 0 (survival) or 1 (creative)**<br/><br/>Alias: `/gm`<br/><br/>Corresponds to the vanilla minecraft command `/gamemode` except it only supports gamemode 0 and 1 .<br/><br/>The gamemode is changed only client side, fly can be enabled on both gamemodes using the `/fly` command.<br/><br/>This command isn't completely useless, gamemode 1 can be used to instantly break blocks on servers with instant break allowed, it is useless for everything else i think.<br/><br/>
**/mine** | **Automatically breaks blocks under your feets OR blocks you're looking at**<br/><br/>This command toggles auto-mine ON and OFF.<br/>Auto-mine basically breaks blocks in the range of 6 or 13 blocks depending on your gamemode server side (13 for creative and 6 for survival)<br/><br/>The blocks will take the normal time needed to break them (if you're in creative the blocks will break instantly, if you're in survival it depends on the block and on the tool used), the only thing that changes is: you don't have to hold down a button, can be useful on prison servers.<br/><br/>The block which is broke depends on the command configuration (can't be changed in-game) and can either be the block under your feets OR the block you're looking at<br/><br/>
**/nvision** | **Toggles night vision (effect to see in the dark)**<br/><br/>This command toggles night vision ON and OFF.<br/>Night vision is a minecraft effect which gives you the ability to see in the dark<br/>It is better than only changing the time because it also removes shadows and you can see in caves for example. You don't need thorches anymore!<br/><br/>
**/haste** | **Toggles haste effect**<br/><br/>This command toggles the haste effect. When enabled it will let you mine faster.<br/><br/>
**/xray \[mode\]** | **Toggles Xray texture pack. [mode]: "onthefly" or "standard"**<br/><br/><br/><br/>
**/jump \[value\]** | **Gives the jump effect with an amplifier of "value" (from 1 to 10)**<br/><br/>This command will give you the jump effect which will let you jump higher.<br/>The effect amplifier can be a value from 1 to 10. For instance:<br/><br/>`/jump 3` will give you the jump effect with an amplifier of 3<br/>`/jump` alone will remove the effect<br/><br/>
**/time \[value\]** | **Sets the time to a value from 0 (day) to 14000 (night)**<br/><br/>Alias: `/timeset`<br/><br/>Self explanatory command i think. Corresponds to the vanilla minecraft command `/time set`<br/><br/>
**/spam \[RATEx msg\]** | **Spams msg at a rate of RATE messages per second (no msg stops the spam)**<br/><br/>This command will send "msg" to the server as if you were typing "msg" in the chat RATE times per second.<br/>You can spam commands as well, just put a dot before the / of the command you want to spam, like this: `/spam ./tell svile spamming you privately!!!`<br/>The chat will automatically be disabled using this command and can be enabled using `/chat` or by stopping the spam.<br/>To stop the spam just use `/spam` without arguments<br/><br/>The **RATE** argument is optional and can be used like this: `/spam 2x two times per second example` , it can also be a float, for example `0.1x` to send the message 0.1 times per second (each 10 seconds, simple math)<br/><br/>
**/chat** | **Toggles the chat (the client won't see chat messages)**<br/><br/>This command toggles the client side chat ON and OFF.<br/>If the chat is disabled then the proxy won't send the client chat,popups,tips<br/>It's useful when you don't want to see the chat due to spam or anything else<br/><br/>
**/stalk \[username\]** | **Follows the specified player (experimental)**<br/><br/>Once you're closer enough to **[username]**, your movements won't be sent to the server anymore. **[username]**'s movements will be sent instead.<br/><br/>To stop stalking, simply type the command without the **[username]** argument<br/><br/>
**/sskin \[displayName\]** | **Saves player skins as PNG & uploads to a file hosting service**<br/><br/>This command will convert and then upload player skins in **.png** format to https://transfer.sh which is a free file hosting service.<br/><br/>I recommend downloading the skin right after uploading it or the link for downloading could expire.<br/><br/>**[displayName]** is the player name whose skin will be "saved". You can find it in the minecraft pause screen, usually the same as the one you see in-game<br/><br/>`sskin` stands for save-skin<br/><br/>
**/players** | **Displays the list of players with the related distance from you**<br/><br/>This command will display in the chat all the players the servers told the client to spawn (player entities) with the related distance in blocks from your actual position.<br/>For example, players in a world different than yours won't be displayed by this command.<br/><br/>This command isn't a replacement for the vanilla `/list` which instead displays a list of ALL the online players.<br/><br/>
**/leash** | **Adds a leash to all the spawned players**<br/><br/><br/><br/>
**/tp \[x\] \[y\] \[z\]** | **Teleports to the specified coordinates**<br/><br/><br/><br/>
**/tap** | **Toggles Tap-Teleport (tap on a block to teleport over it)**<br/><br/>Alias: `/taptp`<br/><br/><br/><br/>
**/coords** | **Toggles the "showcoordinates" game rule**<br/><br/><br/><br/>
**/gui** | **Toggles the ability to open the GUI by quickly sneaking**<br/><br/><br/><br/>
**/w \[msg\]** | **Sends a private message to the client chat OR proxy console**<br/><br/>This command is a kind of the minecraft vanilla command `/tell`<br/>It can be used to send private message between the proxy console and the client mcpe chat.<br/>Useful if someone is at the proxy console and wants to tell you something<br/><br/>
**/chunks** | **Prints received chunks**<br/>
**/deletechunks** | **Used before changing world to avoid saving the previous world chunks**<br/>
**/pos1** | **Sets position 1 OR world spawn to the block under your feets**<br/>
**/pos2** | **Sets position 2 to the block under your feets**<br/>
**/sch \[name\]** | **Exports the current selection in schematic format**<br/>
**/mcr \[name\]** | **Exports the received chunks in mcr world format**<br/>
**/mca \[name\]** | **Exports the received chunks in mca world format**<br/>
**/mcapm \[name\]** | **Exports the received chunks in mcapm world format**<br/><br/>These command are related to the world downloader which can't be used remotely since it saves worlds on the local storage you don't have access to.<br/>You don't have the need to use these commands, it just doesn't make sense to save worlds you can't access.<br/>If you need the world downloader, contact me for more info<br/><br/>There are public world downloaders for minecraft pc, i just created one for mcpe inside of this proxy (this was the my first goal when i started creating the proxy)<br/>It's not a fake/scam, you can for real save server worlds ;) **STEALING** server maps is just something more dangerous and not even correct than using simple hacks, so, for more info contact me privately<br/><br/>
**/r** | **executes the last used command (instead of entirely typing it again)**<br/><br/>This command executes the last used command.<br/><br/>For example if you used `/killaura 5 single` or any other long command and you don't want to type it again.<br/>You can just type `/r` and the last command will be executed, way faster!<br/>R stands for REPEAT! :D<br/><br/>

**/setip \[ip\]** | **Sets the proxy ip relative to you for reconnections**<br/><br/>The proxy is able to get its IP relative to you (the one you wrote in the "mcpe add server window") automatically so you will likely never feel the need to use this command. If you don't understand what this command does, then, using it could also break other functionalities!<br/><br/>
